# OT Threat Modeling Toolkit

**A free, open-source extension for the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, purpose-built for ICS/OT environments.**  
This project brings MITRE ATT&CK for ICS and ISA/IEC 62443 logic into threat modeling, so it can be more easily integrated into the rest of your OT security program.

---

## ‚ú® What It Does

- üß± **Custom OT stencils**: PLCs, RTUs, HMIs, protocols like Modbus and DNP3
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Threat generation rules** based on MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
- üîê **Security Level attributes** (SL-0 to SL-4) for assets, aligned with 62443
- üìä **External scripts** to analyze models, including:
  - Summarizing assets by SL
  - Identifying lowest SL in the model
  - (Coming soon) Detecting SL gaps and threat model drift
- üß∞ Compatible with the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (.tm7 files)

---

## üì¶ Project Status

> üß™ Currently in early preview. Threat generation logic and security level attributes are implemented.  
> CLI utilities and SL evaluation scripts are being added incrementally.  
> See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for upcoming features.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Download and install the [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool).
2. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fortiphyd/ot-threat-modeling.git
```
3. Start the Microsoft TMT
4. Browse and select the `MITRE_ICS.tb7` file under "Template for New Models
5. Choose "Create a Model"
6. Add components to your diagram, threats are generated automatically
7. Use external scripts to analyze `.tm7` files

---

## üîß CLI Scripts

### `summarize_sl.py`

Analyze a `.tm7` model file and summarize the security levels of all assets:

```bash
python summarize_sl.py path/to/model.tm7
```

Example output:

```
Security Level Summary:
  SL-0: 1
  SL-1: 2
  Unknown: 3

```

## üõ£ Roadmap

- [x] Stencils for common OT protocols and assets
- [x] Threat generation from ATT&CK for ICS
- [x] Asset SL attributes (SL-0 through SL-4)
- [x] CLI script to summarize SL usage
- [ ] Reducing threat noise with more intelligent rules
- [ ] Threat model diffing and CI/CD integration
